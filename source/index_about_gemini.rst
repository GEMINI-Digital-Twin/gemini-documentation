About GEMINI
==============================================

GEMINI is a digital twin for geothermal systems in development by TNO since 2020. Its core consists of a monitoring and modelling framework with API's (Application Programming Interface) for interfacing with a database streaming continuous real-time production data coming from a geothermal doublet; from wellbore, to ESP, to topside facilities (filters, heat exchangers, CHP units, etc.). The framework allows not only for the monitoring of raw production data, but also the calculation and visualization of key performance indicators. In addition, the modelling functionalities within the system enable the user to calibrate physical model based on process data, calculate process values at points where no sensors are present, and optimize the system's operating conditions for specific KPIs, suggesting actions to take to improve the doublet's performance.

In this page you can find the links to all pages that give a general overview to the GEMINI architecture, and open-source strategy.
